  Icebears Care was developed over the course of 48 hours for the Seattle Indies 2019 Games For Our Future Game Jam. The jam focuses on raising awareness of environmental issues. In Icebears Care, the player must prevent a pair of icebergs from melting. The player controls a manned boat that contains a giant stapler. They circle an ice berg, firing staples at chunks of ice that have broken away. As long as one iceberg chunk remains when time runs out, the player wins.

  The game was created using Unreal Engine 4. My responsibilities on the team included programming player movement, gameplay mechanics, music and sound cues, and all user interfaces. I used UE4's Blueprint system to implement all programming. Our team was awarded the "Community Choice" award and we showcased the game the following weekend at the May 2019 Seattle Indies Show and Tell.

  The jam was a whole lot of fun and I enjoyed meeting so many talented individuals chasing their dreams! The success of our game would not have been possible without our talented team. We all worked really hard and learned a lot.
